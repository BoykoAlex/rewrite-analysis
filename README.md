## What is this?

This project contains a series of utility functions and visitors to perform complex analysis of source code.

For example:
 - Data flow analysis
 - Control Flow Analysis
 - Fluent AST navigation with an trait-based API similar to [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com).

## How to use?

See the full documentation at [docs.openrewrite.org](https://docs.openrewrite.org/).

## Refactoring at scale with Moderne

OpenRewrite's refactoring engine and recipes will always be open source. Build tool plugins like [OpenRewrite Gradle Plugin](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/gradle-plugin-configuration) and [OpenRewrite Maven Plugin](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/rewrite-maven-plugin) help you run these recipes on one repository at a time. Moderne is a complementary product that executes OpenRewrite recipes at scale on hundreds of millions of lines of code and enables mass committing of results. Moderne freely runs a [public service](https://public.moderne.io) for the benefit of thousands of open source projects.
